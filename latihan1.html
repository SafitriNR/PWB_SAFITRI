        Welcome to the Cool Web Movie Database. So far we offer <br>
        information on the many brilliant films of David Lean : soon, a lot more will be online. <br>

        <h1>Films with Sam Spiegel Productions</h1>
        <h2>The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)</h2>
        <p>Produced by Sam Spiegel, this film was the first of the Lean blockbuster movies, and featured a young Alec Guidness, Willian Holden, and a brillian performance from Sessue Hayakawa.</p>
        <h3>Lawrence of Arabian (1962)</h3>
        One of my all-time favorite movies, this epic adventure starring Peter O'Toole established Lean as a director who could truly envision film on a grand scale.
